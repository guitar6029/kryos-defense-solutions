# KRYOS Defense Solutions — Ops Console (Concept)

KRYOS Defense Solutions is a **fictional brand and UI concept project** built as an engineering and design sandbox.  
The goal of the project is to explore **dashboard architecture, server-state management, and design-system driven UI**, not to represent a real company or production system.

This project is intentionally scoped as a **concept prototype** and is still a work in progress.

---

## 🧭 Project Intent

KRYOS exists to demonstrate:

- Modular dashboard and panel-based UI architecture
- Server-state management using **TanStack Query (via Nuxt Query)**
- Consistent theming using design tokens and Tailwind CSS
- Realistic loading, error, and empty UI states
- A motion-ready structure for future animation work

The application simulates an “operations console” experience commonly found in complex internal tools and data-heavy platforms.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **fictional concept project** created for learning, experimentation, and portfolio demonstration.

- Not a real defense company
- Not a production system
- Data and commands are simulated
- Features and animations are intentionally incomplete

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Nuxt 4**
- **Vue 3 (Composition API)**
- **Pinia** – application state management
- **TanStack Query (Nuxt Query)** – server-state, caching, refetch control
- **Tailwind CSS 4** – styling and design tokens
- **JSON Server** – mock API for simulated backend behavior

---

## 📦 Key Packages

- `nuxt`
- `@peterbud/nuxt-query` (TanStack Query for Nuxt)
- `@pinia/nuxt`
- `@nuxt/ui`
- `@nuxt/fonts`
- `tailwindcss`
- `json-server`

---

## 🔁 Data & State Patterns

- Query-based data fetching with caching and stale time control
- Explicit loading, error, and empty states
- Simulated command flows (queued / acknowledged / failed)
- Mock APIs structured to mirror real backend contracts

---

## 🎨 Visual & Creative Tools

- **ChatGPT** — concept ideation, system naming, UI copy, and structural planning
- **Leonardo.AI** — image and video generation for concept visuals and backgrounds
- **Behance** — visual and layout inspiration from real-world dashboard, sci-fi, and industrial UI projects

---

## 🚧 Roadmap (Conceptual)

- Micro-interactions and motion pass
- Expanded command simulation logic
- Accessibility refinements
- Deeper state visualization and feedback loops

---

## ▶️ Running the Project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Optional mock API:

```
npm run json:server
```

This project is primarily intended as a portfolio case study showcasing frontend architecture, UI systems, and server-state patterns.
